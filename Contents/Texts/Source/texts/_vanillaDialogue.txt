What i think i seen was a final battle[NL]
against Black Dragon and their forces..[A][NL]
Are you absolutely sure you are good[NL]

is an evergrowing clusterfuck[A][NL]
Madness[...] what madness have conquered[NL]
the minds of our parents and nobility[NL]

causing chaos they can remove seeds of[NL] 
rebellion before they will happen in the[NL]
next war against Echea or Imperium[..][NL]
Then they are mad[A] We are nothing[NL] 
without commonfolk, they are levies we use[NL]
they are source of food we eat and taxes[NL]

humans. Cyric, Nesia we should acelerate[NL]
