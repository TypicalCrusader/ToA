/**
 * Although I do plan to redo the whole MovePath routine,
 * but at the moment, we just need only a very small change and
 * then all the problems are solved...
 * Well, since the problem can be solved so concisely and clearly,
 * then this solution is the optimal solution LOL...
 *
 * But also need to note that,
 * since for now move-path can just support no more than 20 steps.
 * If the character moves too far, there will still be in problem.
 * We need to make more changes in the future.
 * For example:
 * 1. expand the move-path limitations to a large enough amount or
 * 2. directly remove the move path, let unit directly move with cursor movement.
 *
 * Current Idea:
 * in bmpatharrowdisp.c L236:
 *
 * #if CHAX
 *     if (gpPathArrowProc->pathCosts[gpPathArrowProc->pathLen] <= 0)
 * #else
 *     if (gpPathArrowProc->pathCosts[gpPathArrowProc->pathLen] == 0)
 * #endif
 *         CutOffPathLength(1);
